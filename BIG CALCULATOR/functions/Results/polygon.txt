   Operation: sum of angles
   Formula used: 
    n = sides
    j = sum of angles
    u = interior angle
    sum of angles: (n-2) * 180 = j
    interior angle: j / n = u
    exterior angle: 360 - u
   sum of Angles: 6120.0
   Interior Angle: 170.0
   Exterior Angle: 190.0
   All sides: 36.0
