# Big-calculator
Big-calculator is literally just a calculator with a bunch of functions, it is important to note this calculator doesn't work like regular one and instead uses formulas
This calculator is very primitive in the scope of other calculators on the web as I made this my personal project so I can use it in school

Please use a code compiler to run this and have a version of python 3.10

This calculator DOES NOT:
              have 3d objects as calculation option
              proper save file placement
              UI
              work in versions below 3.10(as said above)
              Physics calculations ( I do not have any formulas for it)
              Functions
              Fractions
