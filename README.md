# Big-calculator
Big-calculator is literally just a calculator with a bunch of functions, it is important to note this calculator doesn't work like regular one and instead uses formulas
This calculator is very primitive in the scope of other calculators on the web as I made this my personal project so I can use it in school

Steps to run this:
1. |Download a code editor such as VSC [https://code.visualstudio.com/]
2. |then downloading python 3.10 [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
3. |AND then download the file, put it in the directory of vsc then you're good to go

This calculator DOES NOT:
1. | have 3d objects as calculation option
2. | proper save file placement
3. | UI
4. | work in versions below 3.10(as said above)
5. | Physics calculations ( I do not have any formulas for it)
6. | Functions
7. | Fractions
